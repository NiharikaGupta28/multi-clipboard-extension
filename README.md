# Multi-Clipboard Extension

Are you tired of losing your copied text? This Chrome extension solves the common problem of the single-item clipboard by saving a history of everything you copy or cut.

## Features:
* **Automatic Capture:** Saves all text copied (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C) and cut (Ctrl+X / Cmd+X).
* **Persistent History:** Stores copied items locally within your Chrome browser.
* **Easy Access Popup:** Click the extension icon in your toolbar to view your history.
* **Select and Paste:** Click any item in the history to quickly re-copy it to your system clipboard for pasting.
* **Configurable History Limit:** Set how many items to keep via an options page.
